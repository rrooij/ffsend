  Easily and securely share files and directories from the command line through
  a safe, private and encrypted link using a single simple command
  Files are shared using the Send service and may be up to 2GB
  Others are able to download these files with this tool
  or through their webbrowser.

  All files are always encrypted on the client,
  and secrets are never shared with the remote host.
  An optional password may be specified, and a default file lifetime of 1
  (up to 20) download or 24 hours is enforced to ensure your stuff does not
  remain online forever. This provides a secure platform to share your files.
